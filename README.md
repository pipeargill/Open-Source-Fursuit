# Open-Source-Fursuit
Open Cosplay/fursuit base build around the 3M 6000 series respirator

Outline of project so far:

I've recently discovered that I prefer wearing a respirator mask over taking allergy meds for my seasonal allergies. Like, I've used a full face 3M at work and ended up buying one of those and a half mask for pretty cheap off Amazon. The awesome thing about these is that they would make perfect mount points for a suit head. I'm modeling out the adapter plates in Fusion 360 currently, but it's not a hard concept. I've gathered a few open-sources 3D skull or dragon muzzles to put onto the adapter, but I want to try to do some modularity when possible. Also these masks would lend really well to original protogen designs.

As a path for further development I want to add accessories and electronics that work for various things. 

Motorcycle/MTB helmet version, potentially with oxygen supply for various reasons.

Some sort of transhumanist stillsuit is my goal. The air isn't getting any cleaner and so I want to help normalize being able to wear a mask in more situations.
