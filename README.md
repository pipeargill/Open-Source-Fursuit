# Open-Source-Fursuit

For organization sake I am structuring my wearable projects into 3 main categories:

Open-Source Cosplay 
This category is for parts and techniques related to turning 3D designs into wearables. Think hard shell armor and character faces printed directly.

Open-Source Fursuit
This category is for parts and techniques related to turning character concepts into wearables that utilize a fabric, textile, or faux-fur outer layer. 

Open-Source Cyberwear 
This category is for functional parts that add to a wearables functionality or act as some sort of usability aid or prosthesis. Think anything from lights and sounds to standing support to digileg to wearable information and computer systems.

This is a bonus category that I will be throwing any tools I design along the way.



Open Cosplay/Fursuit Base Build for 3M 6000 Series Respirator Mask

Project Overview 

This project revolves around adapting the 3M 6000 series respirator mask into a versatile platform for building cosplay and fursuit heads. I’ve discovered that wearing a respirator mask, especially for seasonal allergies, is not only more comfortable than taking allergy medications but also provides a unique opportunity to design custom headgear that attaches securely to a mask.

The 3M masks are affordable, fairly comfortable, feature an anti-fog exhaust port, and have adjustable straps; making them ideal for attaching various 3D-printed head designs. The aim of this project is to create modular adapters and accessories that allow the creation of custom cosplay, fursuit, or cyberwear designs that can be easily attached to the mask, with plans to integrate electronics and additional functionality. 

Current Development 

I am currently working on 3D modeling the adapter plates, and I've gathered open-source 3D designs that should be compatible with the mask. However, the long-term goal is to make the system modular to allow users to easily swap parts based on their design needs or be able to relief cut their own design into a compatible part for this system.

Remote Air Supply, these adapters seem expensive for no good reason. Will soon design adapters for CPAP hoses and other common air supply methods.

Accessories and Electronics 

In addition to the base adapter, I envision adding accessories such as: 

Motorcycle/MTB Helmet Integration: A version that works with a full face helmet ontop of a half mask.

Transhumanist Stillsuit: With a focus on adapting to air quality concerns, this suit aims to normalize mask-wearing in everyday life with potential for oxygen or inhaler supply.

Mobility Support: Features focused on user needs such as standing, walking, or wheelchair/mobility aid adapters.

Electronic Integrations: Future designs will incorporate electronics like heads up displays, lights, external displays, speakers, and fans to create advanced digital cosplay or cyberpunk wearables.

Meshtastic/radio- embedding comms systems

Wide View Parascopes: For TV head/Foreverwinter digital shaman design. May end up doing a video feed, but I want to experiment with mirrors a bit here. 

Space Marine/Zaku/Jin Roh suit: Focus on larger/bulky armored cosplay base

Tactical/utilitarian suit: a base focused on practical use over form.

Ballistics- use of embedded printed structures that help resist bullet impacts -explore molecular geometries such as diamond, double diamond, graphine, and variations on these structures.

TV Head Prince Robot IV: TV head character that I plan to cosplay, should make good base design.

Puppet head on long neck: I want to try this as a way to add more articulation to a head that is puppeted on top of the user's head.


Log:

Proof of Concept - Test Print 1 (12/1/24) 

![20241201_193228](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fa09887-2368-43ce-a3f5-a60393812566)


First Prototype Notes

The first prototype was a simple test design to see how the 3D print would attach to the exhaust port of the respirator mask. 

Prototype: Horse skull adapter for 3M 6200 half-mask respirator. 

Objective: Test fit, angle adjustment, and clearance.

Result: Mostly a failure, but it was able to be mounted and allowed me to measure how far I was off.

I'm really excited to announce my first actually documented open project! Since I don't have to be a printer tech and can just prototype I've started working on one of my ideas! This is printing now and I'll post an update when I go home to feed the cats for lunch. #fursuiting #open-source

### Philosophy & Goals

I am putting this at the end because it is both the most and least important part of these wearable projects. Uncontrollable yapping to follow:
 
This project is born out of a personal need to filter pollen while being active, particularly while mountain biking. My alergies are bad and medically relavent, but my needs are minor compaired to what that of my friends and people I've known. The risk of losing the freedom to cover our face and protect our bodies is real and it is terrifying for the immunocompromised folk. [Some More News - Mask Bans](https://youtu.be/XTNBMVoFqN8?si=kvrvwtuGsiLRsKs5)

Respirators like the 3M 6000 series offer better face comfort compared to disposable dust masks and keep hot air off the face, and I aim to build on that technology for broader and more creative daily use.

Face recognicion means that we are increasingly carrying our identifcation papers on our face, and banning masks at protests insures that the ability to protest without being doxxed and harassed will be vanishing. 
Privacy as a fundamental human right, recognized in Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)

I believe in promoting the normalization of mask-wearing in society, not just for protection but as a form of self-expression. With growing concerns about pollution, microplastics, and airborne diseases, wearable filters will become more important for our collective future. By developing open, modular, and functional headgear, I hope to support a creative outlet for the community and help others embrace volentary personal protection in more contexts.

[List of medical reasions to need a mask in public]

An extremely important note to make is that for many people mask wearing and protecting one's body are extremely important religious and cultural rights that should not be disrespected, appropreated, or the expression of suppressed.
Here is a list:

Christianity:
1 Corinthians 6:19-20: “Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit... therefore honor God with your bodies.”

Exodus 34:29-35 (The Bible): Moses veils his face after descending from Mount Sinai because his face shines from speaking with God. Many modern Christians speak with God regurally, and are often called to action by God. They would be following Moses' tradition by covering their face.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many churches referenced Leviticus 13:45-46, which outlines isolation and covering the mouth of individuals with contagious conditions, as biblical support for mask-wearing.

Judaism:

Isaiah 6:2: Describes seraphim covering their faces in the presence of God, which can symbolize reverence and humility.

Masks and costumes are central to Purim celebrations, expressing joy and creativity in a religious context.

Buddhism:

Dhammapada 231-233: “One should guard oneself... Protect your body, for it is the vehicle of your spirit.” This emphasizes taking care of one’s body, which can extend to wearing masks for health or ritual purposes.
    
Buddhist monks and practitioners in some traditions wear face coverings (e.g., in Japan and Korea) to protect life, reflecting the principle of Ahimsa (non-harm).

Sikhism:

Guru Granth Sahib: “Body and mind belong to the One who owns the soul... Preserve the self in purity.” (SGGS, Ang 727). Sikh teachings emphasize maintaining health and cleanliness as part of spiritual discipline.

Taoism:

Tao Te Ching 50: “He who protects his body as sacred has found his purpose.”

Hindu:

In Hindu traditions, masks are often used in performances like Kathakali or Ramayana reenactments, symbolizing deities and characters.

Shinto:

Masks are worn in traditional rituals to represent kami (spirits) and protect participants in sacred spaces from impurity.

Indigenous Spiritualities:

Masks play a significant role in Native American, Australian Aboriginal, African, and other indigenous ceremonies. They are worn for expression, storytelling, and connecting with the spiritual world. Many of these traditions have been lost but if anyone would like to share specific examples please reach out to me.

This is not an exaustive list and I am not an expert, but there is enough information here to show that determining if an individual's reasion for wearing a mask is either religion or medical is an impossible task without legally enguaging with them, which authorities often will not have cause to do. This information is here to help protect the public and give aid to those who wish to challenge unjust or unconstitutional laws in the United States. I make no warrenties, do your own research. I am not a lawyer, I am a silly clown person who says silly thing.
