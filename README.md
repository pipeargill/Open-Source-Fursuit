Open Cosplay/Fursuit Base Build for 3M 6000 Series Respirator Mask 

Project Overview 

This project revolves around adapting the 3M 6000 series respirator mask into a versatile platform for building cosplay and fursuit heads. I’ve discovered that wearing a respirator mask, especially for seasonal allergies, is not only more comfortable than taking allergy medications but also provides a unique opportunity to design custom headgear that attaches securely to a mask. 

The 3M masks are affordable, fairly comfortable, feature an anti-fog exhaust port, and have adjustable straps; making them ideal for attaching various 3D-printed head designs. The aim of this project is to create modular adapters and accessories that allow the creation of custom cosplay, fursuit, or cyberwear designs that can be easily attached to the mask, with plans to integrate electronics and additional functionality. 

Current Development 

I am currently working on 3D modeling the adapter plates, and I've gathered open-source 3D designs that should be compatible with the mask. However, the long-term goal is to make the system modular to allow users to easily swap parts based on their design needs or be able to relief cut their own design into a compatible part for this system.

Accessories and Electronics 

In addition to the base adapter, I envision adding accessories such as: 

Motorcycle/MTB Helmet Integration: A version that works with a full face helmet ontop of a half mask.

Transhumanist Stillsuit: With a focus on adapting to air quality concerns, this suit aims to normalize mask-wearing in everyday life with potential for oxygen or inhaler supply.

Mobility Support: Features focused on user needs such as standing, walking, or wheelchair/mobility aid adapters.

Electronic Integrations: Future designs will incorporate electronics like heads up displays, lights, external displays, speakers, and fans to create advanced digital cosplay or cyberpunk wearables.

Future Designs 

Wide View Parascopes: For TV head/Foreverwinter digital shaman design. May end up doing a video feed, but I want to experiment with mirrors a bit here. 

Space Marine/Zaku/Jin Roh suit: Focus on larger/bulky armored cosplay base

Tactical/utilitarian suit: a base focused on practical use over form

TV Head Prince Robot IV: TV head character that I plan to cosplay, should make good base design.

Puppet head on long neck: I want to try this as a way to add more articulation to a head that is puppeted on top of the user's head.


Log:

Proof of Concept - Test Print 1 (12/1/24) 

First Prototype Notes

The first prototype was a simple test design to see how the 3D print would attach to the exhaust port of the respirator mask. 

Prototype: Horse skull adapter for 3M 6200 half-mask respirator. 

Objective: Test fit, angle adjustment, and clearance.

Result: Mostly a failure, but it was able to be mounted and allowed me to measure how far I was off.

Philosophy & Goals

This project is born out of a personal need: the ability to filter pollen while being active, particularly during mountain biking. Respirators like the 3M 6000 series offer superior comfort and function compared to disposable dust masks, and I aim to build on that technology for broader uses.

I also believe in promoting the normalization of mask-wearing in society, not just for protection but as a form of self-expression. With growing concerns about pollution, microplastics, and airborne diseases, wearable filters will become more important for our collective future. By developing open, modular, and functional headgear, I hope to provide a creative outlet for the community and help others embrace mask-wearing in more contexts.

In a world that’s increasingly concerned with surveillance and the loss of privacy, this project also embraces the freedom to wear masks and alter one's appearance. I support the idea of using masks as a form of personal expression, while also recognizing the importance of respecting others' rights and freedoms.

Community & Open-Source Vision

As part of the Open Source Fursuit Project, I hope to create a space where makers and designers can collaborate on wearable tech, cosplay, and cyberpunk gear. I welcome contributions, ideas, and variations from the community, as I believe this project can go in many exciting directions.

Whether you’re a furry, a cosplayer, or a transhumanist designer, this project is meant to empower you to build unique creations that push the boundaries of wearable tech. I hope for my design to start a trend for creative and functional wearable designs, and I can’t wait to see how others will build on these ideas.
