# Open-Source-Fursuit

For organization sake I am structuring my wearable projects into 3 main categories:

Open-Source Cosplay 
This category is for parts and techniques related to turning 3D designs into wearables. Think hard shell armor and character faces printed directly.

Open-Source Fursuit
This category is for parts and techniques related to turning character concepts into wearables that utilize a fabric, textile, or faux-fur outer layer. 

Open-Source Cyberwear 
This category is for functional parts that add to a wearables functionality or act as some sort of usability aid or prosthesis. Think anything from lights and sounds to standing support to digileg to wearable information and computer systems.

This is a bonus category that I will be throwing any tools I design along the way.

Open Cosplay/Fursuit Base Build for 3M 6000 Series Respirator Mask

Project Overview 

This project revolves around adapting the 3M 6000 series respirator mask into a versatile platform for building cosplay and fursuit heads. I’ve discovered that wearing a respirator mask, especially for seasonal allergies, is not only more comfortable than taking allergy medications but also provides a unique opportunity to design custom headgear that attaches securely to a mask.

The 3M masks are affordable, fairly comfortable, feature an anti-fog exhaust port, and have adjustable straps; making them ideal for attaching various 3D-printed head designs. The aim of this project is to create modular adapters and accessories that allow the creation of custom cosplay, fursuit, or cyberwear designs that can be easily attached to the mask, with plans to integrate electronics and additional functionality. 

Current Development 

I am currently working on 3D modeling the adapter plates, and I've gathered open-source 3D designs that should be compatible with the mask. However, the long-term goal is to make the system modular to allow users to easily swap parts based on their design needs or be able to relief cut their own design into a compatible part for this system.

Remote Air Supply, these adapters seem expensive for no good reason. Will soon design adapters for CPAP hoses and other common air supply methods.

Accessories and Electronics 

In addition to the base adapter, I envision adding accessories such as: 

Motorcycle/MTB Helmet Integration: A version that works with a full face helmet ontop of a half mask.

Transhumanist Stillsuit: With a focus on adapting to air quality concerns, this suit aims to normalize mask-wearing in everyday life with potential for oxygen or inhaler supply.

Mobility Support: Features focused on user needs such as standing, walking, or wheelchair/mobility aid adapters.

Electronic Integrations: Future designs will incorporate electronics like heads up displays, lights, external displays, speakers, and fans to create advanced digital cosplay or cyberpunk wearables.

Meshtastic/radio- embedding comms systems

Wide View Parascopes: For TV head/Foreverwinter digital shaman design. May end up doing a video feed, but I want to experiment with mirrors a bit here. 

Space Marine/Zaku/Jin Roh suit: Focus on larger/bulky armored cosplay base

Tactical/utilitarian suit: a base focused on practical use over form.

Ballistics- use of embedded printed structures that help resist bullet impacts -explore molecular geometries such as diamond, double diamond, graphine, and variations on these structures.

TV Head Prince Robot IV: TV head character that I plan to cosplay, should make good base design.

Puppet head on long neck: I want to try this as a way to add more articulation to a head that is puppeted on top of the user's head.

Proof of Concept - Test Print 1 (12/1/24) 

![20241201_193228](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fa09887-2368-43ce-a3f5-a60393812566)


First Prototype Notes

The first prototype was a simple test design to see how the 3D print would attach to the exhaust port of the respirator mask. 

Prototype: Horse skull adapter for 3M 6200 half-mask respirator. 

Objective: Test fit, angle adjustment, and clearance.

Result: Mostly a failure, but it was able to be mounted and allowed me to measure how far I was off.

I'm really excited to announce my first actually documented open project! Since I don't have to be a printer tech and can just prototype I've started working on one of my ideas! This is printing now and I'll post an update when I go home to feed the cats for lunch. #fursuiting #open-source

License & Usage

12/13/24 MIT License over GNU 3
I decided to go full permissive with this design because I want to make these concepts accessible and I want to build my reputation as a designer. You can absolutely use my work, just credit Pipeargill and link to this github.

Philosophy & Goals

This project is born out of a personal need: the ability to filter pollen while being active, particularly while mountain biking. Respirators like the 3M 6000 series offer better face comfort compared to disposable dust masks, and I aim to build on that technology for broader uses.

I also believe in promoting the normalization of mask-wearing in society, not just for protection but as a form of self-expression. With growing concerns about pollution, microplastics, and airborne diseases, wearable filters will become more important for our collective future. By developing open, modular, and functional headgear, I hope to provide a creative outlet for the community and help others embrace mask-wearing in more contexts.

In a world that’s increasingly concerned with surveillance and the loss of privacy, this project also embraces the freedom to wear masks and alter one's appearance. I support the idea of using masks as a form of personal expression, while also recognizing the importance of respecting others' rights and freedoms.

Community & Open-Source Vision

As part of the Open Source Fursuit Project, I hope to create a space where makers and designers can collaborate on wearable tech, cosplay, and cyberpunk gear. I welcome contributions, ideas, and variations from the community, as I believe this project can go in many exciting directions.

Whether you’re a cosplayer or just someone who wants to breathe better, this project is meant to empower you to build unique creations that push the boundaries of wearable tech. I hope for my design to start a trend for creative and functional wearable designs, and I can’t wait to see how others will build on these ideas.
